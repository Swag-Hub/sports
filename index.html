            Sports is one of the most fundamental thing of our daily life for human beings. Sports and games
            are

            a
            difference between sports and games. Sports can only be played outdoors while games can be
            played
            indoors also. Outdoor sports are sports that are played outside it an open space. Outdoor sport
            has
            many
            benefits. Outdoor sports includes running, jumping etc. Which increase our blood flow. Outdoor
            sports
            keep a person healthy fit. As it increases the blood flow the heart constantly pumps blood which
            makes
            the heart strong. Outdoor sports includes a lot of physical exercise which helps to lose weight
            &
            Keep
            the body fit both externally & internally, while playing outdoor sports we can be with natures,
            in
            hailing the fresh air which rejuvenates our body. The sunlight acts at Vitamin D for the body
            Outdoor
            sports highly increases the stamina of a person. Indoor Games are of great way of spending time
            with

            significance in enhancing our lives, especially for growing children. As a student, one has to face many
            challenges, and playing sports helps them cope with the exam pressure and prepare them for further
            challenges by providing them with physical and mental strength.

            Children who are indulged in physical activities sustain good values of mutual respect and cooperation.
            Playing sports teaches them skills such as accountability, leadership, and learning to work with a sense of
            responsibility and confidence.
            In today's era of excessive competition and changing environment, people barely care about our health and
            have to face its consequences in the later stages of their life. They easily become prey to many
            life-threatening health issues. Those who are indulged in regular physical activities can easily defend
            themselves from such diseases. Therefore, playing sports can resolve this concern.

            Playing regular sports can help maintain diabetes, improve heart function, and reduce stress and tension in
            an individual.
